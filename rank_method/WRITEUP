Task 1: bitvector rank writeup

-----------------------------------

My implementation uses three tables, Rs, Rb, and Rp.
First I creates a superblock table in which there are log^2(n)/2 bits per superblock.
Then I create a block table which has logn/2 bits per block.
Then I create a lookup table Rp which has the rank for each logn/2-size block type.
Then for a given rank query, I sum up the results from each table to yield the final rank result.

The hardest part of implementation:
I ran into a myriad of issues with C++, which took up a disproportional majority of my time. This is largely due to my lack of C++ experience. 
Importing the sdsl-lite (and BitArray) libraries took a lot of debugging, and once I got those to work my program didn't compile. The default compiler my system/IDE (Jetbrains CLion) was using was fundamentally flawed, I found out too late. So I switched to using g++, upon the kind suggestion of a fellow classmate on Piazza, and that ended up working.
